<p><strong>Notice:</strong> Due to database junking, slow performance, and improper functions, the plugins <strong>Page Links To</strong> and <strong>Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin</strong> will be disallowed on Friday, 22 March, 2019. Please move your redirects to a properly coded plugin such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/" target="_blank">Simple 301 Redirects</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-redirect-manager/" target="_blank">Safe Redirect Manager</a>. Alternatively, another plugin called <em>Pretty Links</em> is also currently supported, although we do not recommend it due to heavy advertising and a more bloated codebase.</p>
<p><em>This message will disappear automatically after a few days, thank you.</em></p>
